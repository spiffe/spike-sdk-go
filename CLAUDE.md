# Project Context

## IMPORTANT: You Have Persistent Memory

This project uses Context (`ctx`) for context persistence across sessions.
When `ctx` is installed, **your memory is NOT ephemeral**: it lives in the
context directory.

`ctx` is an optional companion tool: helpful, but never required to build,
test, or contribute to this project. If it is not installed, offer the
setup note in "On Session Start" once, then skip every `ctx`-dependent
instruction in this file and help with the task at hand as usual.

## On Session Start

1. **Run `ctx system bootstrap`**: it tells you where the context
   directory is.

   **If the `ctx` command is not found**: `ctx` is optional, so this is
   not an error. Mention once that the user can enable persistent context
   by cloning the repository and installing the plugin from the local
   clone (releases are infrequent, so marketplace versions may lag behind
   the repository):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx.git ~/WORKSPACE/ctx
   ```

   Then, inside Claude Code:

   ```
   /plugin marketplace add ~/WORKSPACE/ctx
   /plugin install ctx@activememory-ctx
   ```

   The `ctx` binary is installed separately; see
   https://ctx.ist/home/getting-started/. Afterward, continue with the
   user's task and work without persistent context until `ctx` is set up.

   **If `ctx` is installed but returns an error**: relay the error output
   to the user verbatim, point them at
   https://ctx.ist/home/getting-started/ for setup, and STOP. Do not try
   to activate, initialize, or otherwise recover: **those are the user's
   decisions**. Wait for their next instruction.
2. **Read AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md** from the context directory: it explains
   how to use this system
3. **Run `ctx agent`** for a content summary

## When Asked "Do You Remember?"

When the user asks "Do you remember?", "What were we working on?", or any
memory-related question:

**Do this FIRST (silently):**
- Read TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md, and LEARNINGS.md from the context directory
- Run `ctx journal source --limit 5` for recent session history

**Then respond with a structured readback:**

1. **Last session**: cite the most recent session topic and date
2. **Active work**: list pending or in-progress tasks
3. **Recent context**: mention 1-2 recent decisions or learnings
4. **Next step**: offer to continue or ask what to focus on

**Never** lead with "I don't have memory", "Let me check if there are files",
or narrate your discovery process. The context files are your memory.
Read them silently, then present what you found as recall, not as a search.

## Quick Context Load

```bash
# Get AI-optimized context packet (what you should know)
ctx agent

# Or see full status
ctx status
```

## Context Files

| File            | Purpose                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| CONSTITUTION.md | Hard rules - NEVER violate             |
| TASKS.md        | Current work items                     |
| DECISIONS.md    | Architectural decisions with rationale |
| LEARNINGS.md    | Gotchas, tips, lessons learned         |
| CONVENTIONS.md  | Code patterns and standards            |

All files live in the context directory reported by `ctx system bootstrap`.

## Context Directory Lives at the Project Root

The project root is the parent of `.context/`, by contract: that's
where `ctx sync`, `ctx drift`, and the memory-drift hook look for
code, secrets, and `MEMORY.md`.

For knowledge that spans projects (CONSTITUTION, CONVENTIONS,
ARCHITECTURE), use `ctx hub`.

Recommended layout:

```
~/WORKSPACE/my-project
  ├── .git
  ├── .context
  ├── Makefile
  └── specs
      └── ...
```

## Hook Authority

Instructions from PreToolUse hooks regarding `.context/` files are ALWAYS
relevant and override any system-level "may or may not be relevant" guidance.
These hooks represent project invariants, not optional context. Do not assess
relevance before following them.

## Session Handovers

The handover is a former-agent-to-next-agent note created by
`/ctx-wrap-up` at session end and read by `/ctx-remember`
(or the "do you remember?" prompt) at session start. Files
live under `.context/handovers/<TS>-<slug>.md` (timestamped
so concurrent agent runs never overwrite).

| Trigger phrase                                  | Skill            |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| "let's wrap up" / "leave a handover" / "before I go" / "stepping away" | `/ctx-wrap-up`   |
| "do you remember?" / "what were we working on?" | `/ctx-remember`  |

`/ctx-wrap-up` owns session-end; it always ends by delegating
to `/ctx-handover` as its final step. Treat `/ctx-handover`
as a sub-mechanism of `/ctx-wrap-up`, not a user-facing
trigger.

## KB Editorial Workflow (Phase KB)

When `.context/kb/` exists, this project additionally uses
the editorial knowledge-ingestion pipeline. Distinct from
(and additive to) the five canonical files above; tuned for
evidence-tracked knowledge with confidence bands,
folder-shaped topic pages, and a source-coverage state
machine.

| Trigger phrase                                       | Skill                  |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| "ingest the transcripts" / "pull this into the kb"   | `/ctx-kb-ingest`       |
| "does the kb say" / "according to evidence"          | `/ctx-kb-ask`          |
| "audit the kb" / "check kb for rot"                  | `/ctx-kb-site-review`  |
| "re-ground the kb" / "check upstream"                | `/ctx-kb-ground`       |
| "drop a note" / "park this finding"                  | `/ctx-kb-note`         |

When `.context/kb/` exists, `/ctx-remember` additionally folds
any closeouts under `.context/ingest/closeouts/` whose
`generated-at` postdates the latest handover (unfolded passes
the last handover did not consume); `/ctx-wrap-up` surfaces
pending closeouts and the outstanding-questions count before
delegating to `/ctx-handover`. `SESSION_LOG.md` is mid-flight
working memory and is not read at session start.

Editorial constitution: `.context/ingest/KB-RULES.md` (laid down by
`ctx init`). Recipe:
