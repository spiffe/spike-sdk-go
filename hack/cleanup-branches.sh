# This script deletes local branches that have already been merged to upstream.
#
# Usage: ./hack/cleanup-branches.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show which branches would be deleted without actually deleting them
#
# The script performs the following steps:
#   1. Fetches the latest changes from origin
#   2. Identifies branches that have been merged to the main branch
#   3. Deletes merged branches (excluding main, master, and current branch)
